    <p> ICU critical care requires well trained nurses, respiratory therapists and physicians to attend to patients
      almost every minute of every hour of every day. Less well staffed hospitals, more prone to burn-out and

      · One of the big learnings of treating very ill Covid-19 patients is that they usually benefit from being “proned”
      – or turned on their stomachs. You can imagine how dicey a procedure it is to turn an adult patient who is

      person power to turn critically ill patients frequently and safely enough. ICU critical care requires well trained
